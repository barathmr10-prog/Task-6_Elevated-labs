I have routed a funtion home to show my portfolio. There I have used jinja code to render the static variable to my template which is Index.html
There I have added html and css format to create a simple webpage and added the jinja code to be rendered
I have added a static contact form in the end of the template with basic validation
I have added both py and html file in this repository
